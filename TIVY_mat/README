         export an TIVY_mat_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory

         pip install --editable .

      3. Instruct flask to use the right application

         export FLASK_APP=TIVY_mat

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/
